/**
 * Capabilities for block_workplanner.
 *
 * The planner only shows and stores data of the user who looks at it, so the
 * view and plan capabilities live in the user context. A user's own plan holds
 * no free text and touches nobody else's data, which is why "plan" and
 * "myaddinstance" carry no risk flag (Semgrep rule moodle-capability-ohne-riskbitmask
 * reviewed: none of RISK_XSS, RISK_SPAM or RISK_PERSONAL applies).
 *
 * Semgrep rule moodle-capability-ohne-archetypes reports "addinstance" and "myaddinstance"
 * because of the extra key clonepermissionsfrom; both have archetypes.
 *
 * @package    block_workplanner
